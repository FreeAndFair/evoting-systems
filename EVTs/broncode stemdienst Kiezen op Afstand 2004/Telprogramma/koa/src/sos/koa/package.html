This package contains the SoS/KOA vote tally application.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p> The <code>sos.koa</code> package is the top-most package of the
SoS/KOA vote tally application. </p>

<p> The SoS/KOA vote tally application is a software program used to
tally the secure election results produced by the <a
href="http://www.minbzk.nl/contents/pages/00018314/voortgangsrap_koa_03_03.pdf">KoA</a>
(Kiezen op Afstand) Hertellen Stemmen application, developed by <a
href="http://www.logicacmg.com/">LogicaCMG</a>, on behalf of the <a
href="http://www.minbzk.nl/">Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom
Relations</a> (Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en
Koninkrijksrelaties). </p>

provided some technical support as well. </p>

<h2>System Structure</h2>

<p> The SoS/KOA application has three main sub-components:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Input/Output</strong> - This subcomponent of the
      system is responsible for performing all file input and output.
      The following classes are part of the <em>data
      input/output</em> subsystem:
      <ul>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.AbstractObjectReader}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.AuditLog}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.AuditLogXMLReader}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.CandidateListXMLReader}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.EasyGenerationContentHandlerProxy}</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data Structures</strong> - The core components of the
      system responsible for representing all data and tallying all
      results.  The following classes are part of the <em>data
      structures</em> subsystem:

        <li>{@link sos.koa.ViewPdf}</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Utility Classes</strong> - A small number of classes are
      utility classes containing code shared by other subsystems.
      The following classes are part of the <em>utility</em>
      subsystem:
      <ul>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.Hex}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.KOAConstants}</li>
        <li>{@link sos.koa.KOAException}</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

{@link sos.koa.AuditLogXMLReader},
{@link sos.koa.CandidateListXMLReader} and
{@link sos.koa.EasyGenerationContentHandlerProxy}

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

<p> The following tools were used to develop the SoS/KOA vote tally
application. </p>

<ul>
  <li> The <a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org/">JML tool suite</a>,
      including the JML runtime assertion checking (RAC) compiler
      <em>jmlrac</em>, the
      JML unit test generation tool <em>jmlunit</em>, and the JML
      documentation generation tool <em>jmldoc</em>. <br />

      The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a behavioral interface
      specification language that can be used to specify the behavior
      of Java modules. It combines the design by contract approach of
      Eiffel and the model-based specification approach of the Larch
      family of interface specification languages, with some elements
      of the refinement calculus. <br />

      JML has been used to express the semantics of all core
      classes of the SoS/KOA application.  The core classes are those
      classes in the <em>data structures</em> subcomponent, discussed
      above.
  </li>

  <li> The <a
      href="http://www.cs.kun.nl/sos/research/escjava/">ESC/Java2</a>
      verification tool <br />

      ESC/Java2 has been used to verify some methods of all data
      structure subcomponents of the SoS/KOA system.  <em>Verify</em>,
      in this context, means that ESC/Java2 was used to automatically
      prove that the provided implementation fulfills the associated
      contract specified with JML. </p>
  </li>

  <li> The <a
      href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html">jProfiler</a>
      Java code profiler
  </li>
      
  <li> The <a href="http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/">jSwat</a>
      graphical Java code debugger
  </li>

  <li> The <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">CheckStyle</a>
      tool
  </li>
      
  <li> The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse development
      environment</a>
  </li>
      
  <li> The <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> text editor
  </li>
      
  <li> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">GNU Emacs</a>

      Development Environment Tools</a>
  </li>
      
  <li> The <a href="http://jdee.sunsite.dk/">Java Development
      Environment for Emacs</a>
  </li>
      
  <li> The <a href="http://ecb.sourceforge.net/">Emacs Code Browser</a>
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Development Methodology</h2>

<p> The SoS/KOA application was developed using the following methodology:

<ul>
  <li> The system design was decomposed into three primary units: Data
      Input & Output, Data Structures, and GUI.</li>

  <li> One developer took responsibility for each component:
      Dr. Engelbert Hubbers (Data I/O), Dr. Joseph Kiniry (Data
      Structures), and Dr. Martijn Oostdijk (GUI). </li>

  <li> It was decided that the classes of the system most critical for
      application correctness were the data structure
      components. Accordingly, these were the components that were to
      be most heavily annotated with JML and where most of the
      testing and verification effort were to be focused. </li>

  <li> Appropriate APIs were chosen for the various subsystems.  The
      primary choices where those of cryptography (a JCE
      implementation), XML data I/O (JDK packages under
      <code>javax.xml</code>), and presentation (Apache FOP and its
      dependencies). </li>

  <li> It was decided that the APIs of this set most critical to
      system correctness were the cryptography APIs.  Thus, JML
      annotations should be written for those APIs as early as
      possible.  Such annotations would help detect incorrect API use
      early in the design process and would be used later for system
      testing and verification. Joe took responsibility for writing
      basic specifications for the crypto APIs. </li>

  <li> Design and development of the Data I/O subsystem and GUI
      subsystem proceeded semi-independently. </li>

  <li> Since the application had a fairly well-specified, sequential
      HCI specification, and because the final results are completely
      dependent upon the data selected, loaded, decrypted, and
      interpreted in a serious of input stages, it was decided that
      a finite-state machine model would be used to specify the GUI
      and Data I/O subcomponents of the system. <br />

      That state machine is embodied in the invariants of the {@link
      sos.koa.MenuPanel} class and their dependencies.  The final verification
      effort depends upon these states to express that the final vote
      tallies the right information. </li>

  <li> The specifications (types and JML annotations) for the classes
      of the core data structures subcomponent were written as
      completely as possible before any code for those classes was
      written.  The specifications were checked, initially and
      continually during development, by running the ESC/Java2
      typechecker and the JML typechecker tools. </li>

  <li> The implementation of the core data structures were written
      according to the previously written specifications.  These
      implementations were checked, using the JML RAC compiler and the
      ESC/Java2 verification tool, continually during development. </li>

  <li> Integration of the three components began when each was nearly
      complete.  During integration a number of small issues were
      brought to light and the design and implementations of the
      related classes were adjusted for integration. </li>

  <li> GUI full system testing began, using the pre-supplied input
      files, as well as some larger fabricated input files.
      Initially, system testing took place only on the Linux
      platform. </li>
      
  <li> Unit tests were generated for all core data structure classes
      of the system using the JML unit test generation tool
      <em>jmlunit</em>.  These test guarantee that every constructor
      and every method of every core class is interactively tested
      against its contract for every interesting data value of the
      system as well for a large set of random input values. <br />

      <!-- (+ 18 33 20 35 48 101) -->
      In a standard test execution, a total of 255 tests were run
      during each test execution cycle.  The test execution cycle has
      been run hundreds of times.  This means that every core class
      has been tested for (tens of) thousands of possible data values.

  <li> The full system was profiled, both during GUI testing and during
      unit testing, to determine if there were any memory or
      performance issues that needed to be resolved.  A few small
      issues were identified and adjusted, but no real problems were
      highlighted during this analysis. </li>
      
  <li> Documentation and specification coverage was analyzed for the
      full system.  It was decided that full coverage was necessary
      only on the core data structure classes, thus they were reviewed
      for 100% coverage. </li>

  <li> GUI system testing took place on the Mac OS X and Windows
      platforms.  The only issue to address on both platforms was how
      to automatically spawn the appropriate PDF viewer to show the
      final reports for the application. </li>

  <li> The User's Guide was written. </li>

  <li> The high-level system documentation (like this file) was
      written. </li>

  <li> The application was delivered to the Ministry. </li>
      
</ul>
