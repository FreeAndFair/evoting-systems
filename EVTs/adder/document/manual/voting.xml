  <section id="before">
    <title>Before You Can Vote</title>

    <para>
      Before you can cast your vote, you need to have some
      authentication credentials.  When you were registered as a voter
      on the Adder server, you should have been presented with a
      username and password.  If you have not received these credentials,
      then you should contact the system administrator who set up the
      election server and ask for them.
    </para>

    <para>
      Provided you have received your username and password, there
      are two ways you can cast your vote. The first is through the
      Adder Web interface, and the second is through the AdderGUI.  If
      you are simply a voter, then you probably want to use the Adder
      Web interface.  In this case, please proceed to <xref
      linkend="adder-web" />.  If you are also functioning as an
      authority or an auditor in the election, then you will probably
      want to use the AdderGUI interface, as it provides you with
      several enhanced options.  In this case, please proceed to <xref
      linkend="addergui" />.
    </para>

    <title>Using the Web Interface</title>

    <para>
      The Adder Web interface provides an easy way to voters to cast
      ballots without needing to install any additional software.
    </para>

    <para>
      The election administrator should have provided you with a URL,
      a username, and a password.  To begin, point your browser at the
      provided URL.  You should be presented with a page as in <xref
      linkend="fig-web-participate" />.

    <title>Using the Graphical Frontend</title>

    <para>
      Your administrator should have provided you with a username, a
      password, a hostname, a procedure name, and an SSL certificate.
      You will need all of these pieces of information in order to use
      AdderGUI for voting.
    </para>

    <section id="addergui-ssl">
      <title>Installing the SSL Certificate</title>
      <para>
        To begin with, launch AdderGUI. If you have not already entered
        the SSL certificate into AdderGUI, you must do so now.  The
        certificate should be in the form of a PEM file.  That is, it
        will look something like below.

        This dialog shows you the ballot question, i.e., the issue to
        be voted on, followed by a list of choices.  You should also
        notice that there are two election parameters, the
        <guilabel>Minimum</guilabel> and <guilabel>Maximum</guilabel>,
        indicating the minimum and maximum number of choices you are
        allowed to select.  You may toggle between selecting and
        unselecting a choice by clicking on it.  Once you are through
        filling out your ballot, click on <guibutton>Encrypt and
        Submit Choice</guibutton>.

      <para>
        When AdderGUI informs you that the ballot has been cast
        successfully, you are now done voting.  If AdderGUI gives you
        any error message after you submit your ballot, contact your
        election administrator.
