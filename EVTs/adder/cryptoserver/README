We assume you are reading this file because you wish to run your own
Adder server.  If this is not the case, please visit the README file
in the top-level directory.

To install an Adder server, you must install the following components.

1) libadder
2) cryptoserver
3) php-adder

This document explains how to configure the cryptoserver.  For help
with libadder and php-adder, you should read the README files in the
'libadder' and 'php-adder' directories, respectively.

Installation of cryptoserver
----------------------------

The dependencies of cryptoserver are:

- libadder
- ACE, version >= 5.4.2
- MySQL++, version = 1.7.19
- MySQL, version >= 4.0.21
- libpopt
- OpenSSL, version >= 0.9.7d

Once all of the dependencies are installed, you can compile and
install cryptoserver as follows.

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Next, you must configure the MySQL database.  Change into the
'database' directory, and enter the following commands.

# mysqladmin create adder
# mysql adder < schema.sql
# mysql adder < permissions.sql

You should now configure the /etc/cryptoserver.conf file to your
liking.

Notes
-----

1) In our experience running Ubuntu on linux/ppc, MySQL++ does *not*
   work with the cryptoserver.  It will crash frequently.
