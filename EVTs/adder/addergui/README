AdderGUI graphical interface to the Adder voting system.  If this is
not the case, please visit the README file in the top-level directory.

System Requirements
-------------------
1. libadder
2. Qt 4
3. QConf
4. Boost.Regex
5. QCA2

Compilation Instructions
------------------------
Type the following commands to build and install AdderGUI:

$ qconf
$ ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --bindir=<bindir> --qtdir=<qtdir>
$ make
$ make INSTALL_ROOT=<INSTALL_ROOT> install

Note: There seems to be a problem with GCC 4.1.  It takes forever to
compile Client.cpp.  Stick with GCC 4.0 for now.
