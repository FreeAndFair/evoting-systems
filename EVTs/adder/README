Adder consists of the following components:

1) libadder - the cryptographic library

2) cryptoserver - the main server

3) php-adder - a set of php scripts to allow voting over the Web

4) mozilla-plugin-adder/AdderCtrl/libadder-java - respectively,
   Mozilla plugin, IE control, and Java applet to be used with
   php-adder (all henceforth refered to as "browser plugins.")

5) AdderGUI - a Qt-based GUI and verification suite for administration
   and advanced election functionality.

If you would like to administer your own election server, you will
want to install libadder, cryptoserver, and php-adder on the server,
and AdderGUI and/or a browser plugin on each of the clients.

If you would like to participate in Adder elections that are already
running, you will only need to install either a browser plugin or
AdderGUI.

These components are divided into their own subdirectories.  For help
on installing the individual components, visit each of the
subdirectories.
